Event Driven Architecture

EDA is a software design pattern in which decoupled applications can
asynchronously publish and subscribe to events/actions or messages via an event broker.

All the apps will use msg broker for async communication

In Eda ,applications communicate with each other by sending
or receiving messages

Since applications are loosely coupled, they can scaled independently with ease.
